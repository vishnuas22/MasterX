# Emotion Detection Engine V9.0 Specification

## Purpose
Real-time emotion detection and response adaptation system that understands student emotional states and adapts learning experiences accordingly.

## Emotional States to Detect

### Primary Emotional Categories
```typescript
enum EmotionalState {
  // Learning-focused emotions
  FRUSTRATED = 'frustrated',     // Difficulty understanding, repeated errors, negative language
  CONFUSED = 'confused',         // Uncertain responses, clarification questions, hesitation
  ENGAGED = 'engaged',           // Active participation, follow-up questions, positive indicators
  CONFIDENT = 'confident',       // Quick responses, seeking challenges, assertive language
  OVERWHELMED = 'overwhelmed',   // Information overload, request to slow down, stress indicators
  CURIOUS = 'curious',           // Exploratory questions, interest in related topics
  SATISFIED = 'satisfied',       // Achievement indicators, positive feedback, goal completion
  ANXIOUS = 'anxious',          // Test anxiety, performance pressure, worry expressions
  BORED = 'bored',              // Disengagement, short responses, topic-changing attempts
  MOTIVATED = 'motivated'        // Goal-oriented, persistent, enthusiasm indicators
}
```

### Emotional State Indicators
```typescript
interface EmotionDetectionCriteria {
  frustrated: {
    text_patterns: ['I don\'t get it', 'this is hard', 'why doesn\'t this work'];
    response_time: 'increasing delay patterns';
    error_frequency: 'repeated incorrect answers';
    linguistic_markers: ['negative sentiment', 'helplessness indicators'];
  };
  
  confident: {
    text_patterns: ['I understand', 'this makes sense', 'what\'s next'];
    response_time: 'quick, consistent responses';
    accuracy_patterns: 'high success rates';
    linguistic_markers: ['assertive language', 'challenge-seeking'];
  };
  
  confused: {
    text_patterns: ['what does this mean', 'I\'m not sure', 'can you explain'];
    response_time: 'inconsistent, often delayed';
    question_types: 'clarification and definition requests';
    linguistic_markers: ['uncertainty indicators', 'hesitation words'];
  };
}
```

## Detection Methods

### 3.1 Multi-Modal Analysis
```typescript
interface EmotionDetectionEngine {
  text_analysis: {
    transformer_model: 'BERT-based emotion classifier';
    sentiment_analysis: 'real-time sentiment scoring';
    linguistic_patterns: 'keyword and phrase pattern matching';
    processing_time: '<200ms per message';
  };
  
  behavioral_analysis: {
    response_timing: 'analyze response speed patterns';
    error_patterns: 'track mistake frequencies and types';
    engagement_metrics: 'measure interaction depth and frequency';
    session_progression: 'monitor learning journey emotional arc';
  };
  
  contextual_analysis: {
    learning_history: 'user\'s past emotional patterns';
    subject_context: 'emotion patterns specific to topics';
    time_patterns: 'emotional state variations by time of day';
    performance_correlation: 'link emotions to learning outcomes';
  };
}
```

### 3.2 Real-time Processing Pipeline
```typescript
interface EmotionProcessingPipeline {
  input_processing: {
    text_preprocessing: 'clean and normalize user input';
    context_injection: 'add relevant historical and session context';
    feature_extraction: 'extract linguistic and behavioral features';
  };
  
  emotion_classification: {
    primary_emotion: 'most likely emotional state (confidence >0.7)';
    secondary_emotion: 'alternative emotional state (if confidence 0.4-0.7)';
    emotion_intensity: 'strength of emotional state (0.0-1.0)';
    confidence_score: 'model confidence in classification (0.0-1.0)';
  };
  
  adaptation_triggers: {
    immediate_adaptation: 'real-time response tone adjustment';
    content_modification: 'difficulty and explanation style changes';
    intervention_alerts: 'flag need for emotional support';
    learning_path_updates: 'suggest session modifications';
  };
}
```

## Response Adaptation System

### 3.3 Emotional Response Strategies
```typescript
interface EmotionalResponseAdapter {
  frustrated: {
    tone: 'encouraging, patient, and supportive';
    explanation_style: 'step-by-step breakdown with more examples';
    difficulty_adjustment: -1; // Reduce difficulty temporarily
    encouragement: 'high level with specific positive reinforcement';
    intervention: 'offer break suggestions or alternative approaches';
  };
  
  confident: {
    tone: 'challenging and engaging';
    explanation_style: 'concise with advanced concepts introduced';
    difficulty_adjustment: +1; // Increase challenge level
    additional_content: 'related advanced topics and applications';
    recognition: 'acknowledge success and build on momentum';
  };
  
  confused: {
    tone: 'clear, patient, and systematic';
    explanation_style: 'structured with multiple approaches';
    clarity_focus: 'ensure understanding before proceeding';
    examples: 'provide multiple concrete examples';
    check_understanding: 'frequent comprehension checks';
  };
  
  anxious: {
    tone: 'calm, reassuring, and confidence-building';
    explanation_style: 'structured and predictable format';
    stress_reduction: 'breathing exercises and mindfulness tips';
    positive_framing: 'focus on progress and capabilities';
    pacing: 'slower, more deliberate progression';
  };
}
```
