- Dynamic difficulty adjustment using IRT (Item Response Theory)
- Neural-based forgetting curves for spaced repetition
- Reinforcement learning for content recommendations
- Semantic similarity for context retrieval

EMOTION-FIRST DESIGN:
- Every AI response considers emotional state
- Provider selection based on emotion
- Difficulty adjusted for cognitive load
- Intervention triggers on frustration/confusion
- Celebration on breakthrough moments

MULTI-AI INTELLIGENCE:
- Intelligent routing based on task + emotion + performance
- Automatic fallback on provider failure
- Cost optimization (30% reduction vs. GPT-4 only)
- Quality optimization (select best provider per task)
