## 🔧 FIXED ISSUES DURING TESTING

### Issue #1: MongoDB Upsert with $inc
**Problem:** First activity record failed with `'total_sessions'` error  
**Cause:** Using `$inc` with `upsert=True` on non-existent fields  
**Fix:** Separate insert vs. update logic for first-time users  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

### Issue #2: MongoDB ObjectId in Leaderboard
**Problem:** Leaderboard returned `ValueError: ObjectId object is not iterable`  
**Cause:** MongoDB `_id` field not excluded in aggregation projection  
**Fix:** Added `"_id": 0` to projection pipeline  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

### Issue #3: Session Tracking
**Problem:** `total_sessions` not incrementing properly  
**Cause:** No session deduplication logic  
**Fix:** Added `last_session_id` tracking and conditional increment  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

---

## 🎯 ALGORITHM VERIFICATION

### Elo Rating System ✅
- **Formula Verified:** `K * (actual_score - expected_score)`
- **Dynamic K-factor:** Adjusts based on games played (16-64)
- **Difficulty Conversion:** Question difficulty → Elo scale (1200-1800)
- **Working:** Increases on success, decreases on failure

### SM-2+ Algorithm ✅
- **Easiness Factor Formula:** `EF' = EF + (0.1 - (5-q) * (0.08 + (5-q) * 0.02))`
- **Interval Progression:** 
  - First: 1 day
  - Second: 6 days
  - Subsequent: `previous_interval * easiness_factor`
- **Quality Scale:** 0-5 (0=blackout, 5=perfect)
- **Lapse Handling:** Resets interval to 0, decreases EF
- **Working:** Exponential interval growth verified over 6 reviews

### XP & Level System ✅
- **XP Formula:** `base_xp * difficulty * time_factor * streak_multiplier`
- **Level Formula:** `level = floor((xp / 100) ^ (1/1.5)) + 1`
- **Exponential Curve:** Verified across levels 1-3
- **Working:** Proper progression observed

### Streak Tracking ✅
- **Daily Activity Check:** Working
- **Streak Multipliers:** 1.0x → 1.1x (3d) → 1.2x (7d) → 2.0x (100d)
- **Streak Freeze:** Not yet tested (requires time manipulation)
- **Working:** Basic streak tracking operational
