```

### Step 3: Start Building (Day 1)
```bash
# Read the plan

## 🎯 PROJECT GOALS

### Core Vision
Build an AI learning platform that:
1. Detects emotions in real-time (BERT/RoBERTa)
2. Routes to best AI provider (10+ providers)
3. Adapts difficulty dynamically (IRT, ZPD algorithms)
4. Manages context intelligently (semantic search)
5. Provides truly personalized learning

### Competitive Advantages
- ✅ Only platform with real-time emotion detection
- ✅ Multi-AI intelligence (10+ providers)
- ✅ No rule-based systems (all ML-driven)
- ✅ Research-grade algorithms
- ✅ True personalization (emotion + performance + context)

### Success Metrics
- Response time < 3s average only real AI responses
- Emotion accuracy > 85%
- Cost < $0.02 per interaction
- Support 10,000+ concurrent users

## 🏗️ DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

### ✅ Vertical Slice Approach (NOT one-file-at-a-time)

**Phase 1 (Week 1): Minimal Viable Flow**
- Build: models → AI provider (Groq only) → server → simplified engine
- Result: One complete learning interaction working

**Phase 2 (Week 2): Intelligence Layer**
- Add: 2 more providers, context management, adaptive learning
- Result: Emotion-aware, context-rich, adaptive responses

**Phase 3 (Week 3): Optimization**
- Add: Caching, performance monitoring, 7+ more providers
- Result: Production-ready, scalable system

**Phase 4 (Week 4): Features**
- Add: Gamification, analytics (optional)
- Result: Feature-complete MVP

### Why This Works
- Always have working system
- Find integration issues early
- Test continuously
- Feature-complete slices

## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **No hardcoded rules** - All ML-driven, real-time
2. **Emotion-first design** - Every decision considers emotion
3. **Clean naming** - Short, professional (not verbose)
4. **Async everything** - Non-blocking operations
5. **Validate all inputs** - Pydantic models
6. **Document why, not what** - Explain reasoning
