CLEAN ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES


1. PEP8 Compliance:
   - Clean, readable code
   - Proper naming conventions
   - Comprehensive docstrings

2. Modular Design:
   - Separation of concerns
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Dependency injection

3. Enterprise-Grade:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging
- Performance monitoring with appropriate timeouts:
  * Database operations: < 100ms
  * AI API calls: 30-60s timeout with retries
  * Cache operations: < 50ms
- Circuit breaker patterns

4. Production-Ready:
   - Real AI integrations (no mocks)
   - Async/await patterns
   - Database connection pooling
   - Response caching

5. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Unit testing (pytest, coverage >80%)
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Code quality tools (pylint, black, mypy)

6. Security Standards

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication & authorization (OAuth2, JWT)
- Secrets management (environment variables, vaults)
- Rate limiting and throttling
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- API key rotation policies

7. Observability & Monitoring

- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Health check endpoints
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Alert management
- SLA/SLO definitions

8. Scalability & Performance

- Horizontal scaling patterns
- Load balancing strategies
- Caching layers (Redis, Memcached)
- Database indexing
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)

9. Documentation Standards

- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- README with setup instructions
- Code comments for complex logic only
- Changelog maintenance (semantic versioning)
- Runbooks for operations

10. Code Organization

- Repository structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
- Configuration management (12-factor app principles)
- Environment-specific configs (dev, staging, prod)
- Docker containerization
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Kubernetes)
- Dependency management (poetry, pip-tools)

11.  Error Handling & Resilience

- Graceful degradation
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Timeout configurations
- Dead letter queues
- Idempotency for critical operations
- Transactional integrity

12. API Design Standards

- RESTful principles (proper HTTP methods/status codes)
- Versioning strategy (URL or header-based)
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Rate limiting headers
- HATEOAS compliance (where applicable)
- GraphQL standards (if applicable)

13. Data Management

- Data validation (Pydantic models)
- Database migrations (Alembic)
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Data retention policies
- GDPR/privacy compliance
- Audit logging

14. AI/ML Specific Standards

- Model versioning and registry
- A/B testing frameworks
- Prompt engineering best practices
- Token usage optimization
- Fallback strategies for AI failures
- Response validation and filtering

15. Type Safety

- Type hints (Python 3.9+ syntax)
- Static type checking (mypy)
- Runtime validation (Pydantic)
- Schema validation for I/O


Critical : ”Use short, meaningful, and professional names for files, classes, and functions. Avoid verbose or decorative naming. Example: prefer quantum_engine.py or engine.py instead of UltraEnterPriseIntegratedQuantumenginev7.py.” .
