CLEAN ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES


1. PEP8 Compliance:
   - Clean, readable code
   - Proper naming conventions
   - Comprehensive docstrings

2. Modular Design:
   - Separation of concerns
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Dependency injection

3. Enterprise-Grade:
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Structured logging
   - Performance monitoring
   - Circuit breaker patterns

4. Production-Ready:
   - Real AI integrations (no mocks)
   - Async/await patterns
   - Database connection pooling
   - Response caching


Critical : ”Use short, meaningful, and professional names for files, classes, and functions. Avoid verbose or decorative naming. Example: prefer quantum_engine.py or engine.py instead of UltraEnterPriseIntegratedQuantumenginev7.py.” .
