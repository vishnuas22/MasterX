Reason: No GPU available in container
Expected with GPU: 10-20x speedup
```

    model = model.half()  # FP16 quantization
```

#### 3.4 torch.compile() Optimization ✅
- PyTorch 2.0+ compilation
- Mode: "reduce-overhead"
- Expected speedup: 1.5-2x

**Status:**
```
✓ Implementation complete
⚠️ Module error: setuptools (FIXED)
✓ Will activate with trained models
```

#### 3.5 Model Pre-warming ✅
- Eliminates cold start latency
- Runs during initialization
- First prediction fast

## Performance Analysis

### Current Performance (CPU-only, Untrained)

**Initialization:**

|--------------|---------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Latency | ~5-10s | ~500-1000ms | ~70-100ms | <100ms |
| Throughput | ~0.1 req/s | ~2 req/s | ~15-20 req/s | >20 req/s |

## What's Missing (Phase 9B) ❌

### 1. Trained Neural Models

**Required for <100ms latency:**

#### PADRegressor (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Purpose: Learn emotion → valence/arousal/dominance from data
- Replaces: Hardcoded emotion-to-PAD mappings
- Dataset: PAD-annotated GoEmotions
- File: Not created yet

#### LearningReadinessNet (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Purpose: Learn readiness weights with attention
- Replaces: Hardcoded weights [0.4, 0.35, 0.25]
- Dataset: Learning effectiveness data
- File: Not created yet

#### InterventionNet (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Purpose: Learn intervention thresholds
- Replaces: Hardcoded thresholds [0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]
- Dataset: Intervention effectiveness data
- File: Not created yet

#### TemperatureScaler (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Purpose: Learn calibration temperature
- Replaces: Hardcoded temperature = 1.5
- Method: Post-hoc validation set calibration
- File: Not created yet

### 2. Training Infrastructure

**Missing Components:**
- Training script for 40 emotions (current trains 13)
- Data loaders for EmoNet-Face dataset
- Multi-task loss function
- Validation/test splits

**Needs Replacement:**
- Use learned PAD scores from PADRegressor
- Use learned readiness from ReadinessNet
- Use learned interventions from InterventionNet

- **Fix:** `pip install setuptools` ✅
- **Status:** Resolved

### Issue 2: No GPU Available
- **Problem:** Running on CPU (100x slower than GPU)
- **Impact:** Latency ~5-10s instead of <100ms
- **Fix:** Deploy to GPU environment OR use CPU-optimized models
- **Status:** Architectural limitation, not a bug

### Issue 3: Untrained Models
- **Problem:** Using random initialization (Phase 1)
- **Impact:** Predictions are meaningless, accuracy ~2.4% (1/41)
- **Fix:** Complete Phase 9B training
- **Status:** Expected - requires training

### Issue 4: API Timeout
- **Problem:** Full pipeline test times out after 60s
- **Impact:** Cannot measure end-to-end latency
